# ScraperGUI
I've always wanted to make GUI program and I thought "why not Web scraper GUI?" because everyone would want to use it! So I sat down and started to brainstorm about what the public would want to see, after I came down to a conclusion and made it then realised that this is not something that I would use so propably nobody else either. But here it is and I still have some ideas to improve it but that have to wait. There are some widgets there that I don't use but I will.. oyeah one day I'll show you and me.

## What is up next?
* Make a a REST call
* Print to file
* Modify the Interface and make more friendly with a little sex appeal

## Something else
* Python 3.5.0
* tKinter
* urllib.request
* html.parser

### RUN: python scraperGUI.py
