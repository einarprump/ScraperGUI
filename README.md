# ScraperGUI
2017: I've always wanted to make GUI program and I thought "why not Web scraper GUI?" because everyone would want to use it! So I sat down and brainstormed about what the public would want to see, the conclusion was what I have here. Then I realised this doesn't have any usability for neither me or the public. But here it is and I still have some ideas to improve it but that have to wait. There are some widgets there that I don't use but I will.. oyeah one day I'll show you and me.\
